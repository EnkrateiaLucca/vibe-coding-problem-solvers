## 💡 Key Concepts

### Vibe Coding vs AI-Assisted Programming

**Vibe Coding**: Building software with an LLM without reviewing the generated code
- ✅ Perfect for: Prototypes, throwaway projects, experiments
- ❌ Avoid for: Production systems, security-critical applications

**AI-Assisted Programming**: Using AI as a "typing assistant" with human oversight
- Balanced approach with code review and understanding
- Suitable for production development

### The 7 Core Skills

1. **Prompting** - Clear, specific instructions with examples
2. **Context Management** - Strategic information loading
3. **Capability Assignment** - Knowing what to delegate to AI
4. **Vibe Checking** - Lightweight verification techniques
5. **Strategic Cognitive Offloading** - 70/30 rule for task distribution
6. **Personal Benchmarking** - Custom evaluation frameworks
7. **Agentic Task Orchestration** - Coordinating multiple AI agents

### Tool Categories

- **Web Builders**: Claude Artifacts, ChatGPT Canvas, Vercel v0
- **IDE Integration**: Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Codium Windsurf
- **Terminal Agents**: Claude Code, Aider
- **Cloud Environments**: Replit, CodeSandbox

## 📋 12 Practical Patterns

1. Start with Prototypes
2. Vibe Checking Checklist
3. Provide Clear Specs
4. Restart When Stuck
5. Let It See What You See
6. Automate Repeatable Steps
7. Build Personal Benchmarks
8. Store Formatting Prompts
9. Generate Synthetic Data
10. Voice Workflows
11. Context-Based Coding
12. Raw to Structured Data

## ⚠️ Safety Guidelines

### Safe Vibe Coding Zone
- Throwaway weekend projects
- Low-stakes experiments
- Learning and prototyping
- Personal tools and scripts

### Production No-Go Zone
- Security-critical applications
- Complex, long-term systems
- Code requiring maintenance by others
- High-stakes business logic
