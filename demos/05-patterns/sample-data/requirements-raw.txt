Password Reset Feature Requirements
====================================

From: Product Team
Date: January 2025

We need a way for users to reset their passwords when they forget them.

Here's what we're thinking:

- User clicks "Forgot Password" on the login page
- They enter their email address
- System sends them an email with a special link
- The link should expire after 24 hours for security
- Link can only be used once (single use)
- When they click the link, they go to a page to enter a new password
- New password must be at least 8 characters
- Should have at least one number and one special character
- Can't reuse any of their last 5 passwords
- After successful reset, redirect to login with a success message
- If the link is invalid or expired, show a clear error message
- Log all password reset attempts for security audit
- Send confirmation email after password is changed
- Rate limit: max 3 reset requests per hour per email

Edge cases to handle:
- Email not found in system (don't reveal this to user for security)
- User already has a pending reset link
- User's account is locked or suspended
- Email service is down (queue for retry)

Nice to have (if time):
- "Remember this device" option after reset
- SMS as alternative to email
- Security questions as additional verification
