## ðŸ”„ How Agents Communicate

### Agent-to-Agent Communication
Agents share information automatically:
- Database Agent tells Frontend Agent about data structure changes
- Security Agent reviews all code changes from other agents
- Testing Agent validates work from all other agents

### Agent-to-You Communication
Each agent explains their work in simple terms:
- **Technical Translation**: "I optimized the database queries" becomes "I made the app load customer information 3x faster"
- **Progress Updates**: "Currently implementing user authentication" becomes "Setting up secure login system - 60% complete"
- **Issue Reporting**: Instead of "NullPointerException in UserController", you get "Found a bug in the user registration process - fixing now"

### Your Communication with Agents
You can talk to specific agents:
- "Security agent, is our payment system safe?"
