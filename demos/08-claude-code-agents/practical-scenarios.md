## üö¶ Managing Agent Workflows

              ‚îú‚Üí Integration Agent ‚Üí Testing Agent
Backend Agent  ‚îò
```
Use when: Different parts can be built independently

**Decision Points**

- "Frontend agent has two design options - which fits our brand better?"

**Quality Gates**
- "Don't proceed to the next phase until testing agent confirms everything works"
