# Getting Started: Your First Multi-Agent Project

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### Phase 1: Project Planning (15 minutes)

**1. Define Your Goal**
Write one sentence describing what you want to accomplish:
- "I want customers to be able to schedule appointments online"
- "I need a system to track inventory and orders"
- "I want to create a blog where I can share articles and readers can comment"

**2. List Your Users**
Who will use this system?
- Customers, employees, managers, visitors, etc.
- What will each type of user need to do?

**3. Identify Key Actions**
What are the 3-5 most important things users should be able to do?
- Register/login, browse products, make purchases
- Create content, moderate comments, view analytics
- Schedule appointments, send reminders, process payments

### Phase 2: Agent Selection (10 minutes)

**Based on your key actions, you'll likely need:**

**User Management** ‚Üí User Authentication Agent
**Data Storage** ‚Üí Database Design Agent  
**Money Handling** ‚Üí Payment Processing Agent
**Visual Interface** ‚Üí Frontend Development Agent
**Behind-the-Scenes Logic** ‚Üí Backend Development Agent
**Quality Assurance** ‚Üí Testing Agent
**Safety & Security** ‚Üí Security Review Agent

### Phase 3: Initial Conversation (20 minutes)

**Start with this template:**

"I want to build [YOUR GOAL]. The main users will be [USER TYPES] who need to [KEY ACTIONS]. I want to make sure it's [SECURITY/PERFORMANCE/USABILITY REQUIREMENTS]. Can you break this down into phases and tell me which agents should work on each part?"

**Example:**
"I want to build an online appointment booking system. The main users will be my clients who need to see available times, book appointments, and receive confirmations, plus me as the business owner who needs to manage my schedule and see booking analytics. I want to make sure it's secure with client data and integrates with my Google Calendar. Can you break this down into phases and tell me which agents should work on each part?"

## üéØ Your First Project: Simple Contact Form

Let's walk through a beginner-friendly project to understand multi-agent workflows.

### Project Goal
Create a contact form for your business website that collects inquiries and emails them to you.

### Agents Needed
1. **Frontend Agent**: Creates the visible form
2. **Backend Agent**: Handles form submission
3. **Email Agent**: Sends notifications
4. **Security Agent**: Prevents spam and attacks
5. **Testing Agent**: Ensures everything works

### Conversation Flow

**You**: "I need a contact form on my website where visitors can send me messages. It should collect their name, email, subject, and message, then email the details to me at mybusiness@email.com. I want to prevent spam and make sure it works on mobile phones."

**Project Planner Agent Response**: 
"I'll break this into 5 phases:
1. Form design and layout (Frontend Agent)
2. Form processing and validation (Backend Agent) 
3. Email delivery system (Email Agent)
4. Spam protection and security (Security Agent)
5. Testing across devices (Testing Agent)

Let me coordinate with the team to get started."

**Frontend Agent**: "I'll create a clean, mobile-friendly form with proper labels and validation messages. Should it match your existing website design?"

**You**: "Yes, use the same colors and fonts as the rest of my site."

**Backend Agent**: "I'll handle the form submission, validate the data, and prepare it for emailing. I'll also add rate limiting to prevent abuse."

**Email Agent**: "I'll set up the email system to send you notifications when someone submits the form. Do you want a copy sent to the person who submitted it as confirmation?"

**You**: "Yes, send them a confirmation that I received their message."

**Security Agent**: "I'll add CAPTCHA protection and input sanitization to prevent spam and security issues."

**Testing Agent**: "I'll test the form on different devices and browsers, and verify that emails are delivered correctly."

### Expected Timeline
- Day 1: Frontend and Backend agents build core functionality
- Day 2: Email agent implements notification system
- Day 3: Security agent adds protection measures
- Day 4: Testing agent validates everything works
- Day 5: Final review and deployment

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools You'll Need

### Minimal Setup
- **Claude Code**: The main interface for working with agents
- **Text Editor**: For reviewing code (Visual Studio Code is free and user-friendly)
- **Web Browser**: For testing your applications
- **Email Account**: For receiving notifications and testing

### Optional but Helpful
- **GitHub Account**: For storing and backing up your code
- **Domain/Hosting**: For making your project available online
- **Basic Analytics**: To track how people use your application

## üí¨ Communication Best Practices

### Do Say
- "I want users to be able to..."
- "The most important feature is..."
- "I need this to work on mobile phones"
- "Can you explain why you chose this approach?"
- "What happens if..."

### Don't Say
- "Make it look professional" (too vague)
- "Add all the features" (scope too broad)
- "I don't care how it works" (you should understand the basics)
- "Just do whatever you think is best" (maintain oversight)

### When You Don't Understand
**Ask for Analogies**: "Can you explain this like I'm not a programmer?"
**Request Visuals**: "Can you show me what this will look like?"
**Get Examples**: "What are some websites that work this way?"
**Clarify Impact**: "How will this affect my users?"

## üìù Project Management Tips

### Weekly Check-ins
- Which agents completed their tasks?
- What challenges did they encounter?
- What decisions do you need to make?
- Are we on track for the original timeline?

### Documentation
Keep simple notes about:
- What each agent is responsible for
- Key decisions and why they were made  
- Login credentials and important URLs
- Contact information for any external services

### Testing Checklist
Before launching any project:
- [ ] Does it work on phones and tablets?
- [ ] Can users complete the main tasks easily?
- [ ] Are error messages helpful and clear?
- [ ] Is sensitive data properly protected?
- [ ] Do you know how to update/maintain it?

## üÜò When Things Go Wrong

### Common Issues & Solutions

**"Agents aren't understanding my requirements"**
- Break down your request into smaller, more specific pieces
- Provide examples of similar systems you like
- Draw or sketch what you're envisioning

**"The project is taking too long"**
- Focus on core features first, add enhancements later
- Ask agents to identify dependencies causing delays
- Consider simplifying initial requirements

**"I'm overwhelmed by technical details"**
- Ask agents to focus on business impact, not technical implementation
- Request weekly summaries instead of daily technical updates
- Delegate technical decisions to agents while maintaining business oversight

**"The result doesn't match what I wanted"**
- Schedule a project review session with all agents
- Clarify which requirements are flexible vs. non-negotiable
- Consider this a learning experience for clearer communication next time

Once you've completed your first project:
- Add a feature to your existing system
- Create a simple database for tracking something important to your business
- Build a basic dashboard to visualize your business data
- Automate a repetitive task you do regularly

### Skill Development
- Learn to ask better questions about technical trade-offs
