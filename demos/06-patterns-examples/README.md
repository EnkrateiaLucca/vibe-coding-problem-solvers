# Demo 6: Exemplifying Patterns for Vibe Coding

## Overview

This demo showcases the 12 practical patterns for effective vibe coding, with real-world examples and implementation guides for each pattern.

## Learning Objectives

- Master the 12 concrete vibe coding patterns
- Understand when and how to apply each pattern
- See practical examples of pattern implementation
- Build a personal pattern library

## The 12 Vibe Coding Patterns

### Quick Reference
1. **Start with Prototypes** - Fuzzy Instruction → Prototype → Refine
2. **Vibe Checking Checklist** - LLM Output → Check → Custom validation
3. **Provide Clear Specs** - Prompt for Spec → LLM Feedback → Refined Spec
4. **Restart When Stuck** - Clear context → Transfer relevant context → Re-prompt
5. **Let It See What You See** - Share screenshots, errors, context
6. **Automate Repeatable Steps** - Create reusable scripts and workflows
7. **Build Personal Benchmarks** - Track failed outputs for retesting
8. **Store Formatting Prompts** - Save transformation patterns
9. **Generate Synthetic Data** - Test with AI-generated sample data
10. **Voice Workflows** - Use voice for initial long instructions
11. **Context-Based Coding** - Use official, up-to-date documentation
12. **Raw to Structured** - Transform unstructured input to structured output

## Files in This Demo

1. **12-patterns-reference.md** - Complete guide to all 12 patterns
2. **pattern-examples/** - Individual files for each pattern with examples

## Demo Flow

1. **Pattern Overview** (5 minutes) - Quick introduction to all 12
2. **Live Examples** (15 minutes) - Demonstrate 4-5 key patterns
3. **Audience Practice** (5 minutes) - Try patterns with real scenarios
4. **Pattern Selection** (5 minutes) - How to choose the right pattern

## Key Patterns for Live Demo

### Essential Patterns (Must Show)
- **Pattern 1: Start with Prototypes** - Foundation of vibe coding
- **Pattern 4: Restart When Stuck** - Critical recovery technique
- **Pattern 5: Let It See What You See** - Context sharing power
- **Pattern 12: Raw to Structured** - Practical data transformation

### Supporting Patterns (If Time Allows)
- **Pattern 2: Vibe Checking Checklist** - Quality control
- **Pattern 6: Automate Repeatable Steps** - Efficiency gains
- **Pattern 8: Store Formatting Prompts** - Reusability

## Success Metrics

Participants should be able to:
- Identify which pattern applies to their current challenge
- Implement at least 3 patterns in their workflow
- Create personal variations of the patterns
- Combine patterns for complex scenarios

## Pattern Selection Decision Tree

```
What's your current situation?
├─ Starting a new project → Pattern 1: Start with Prototypes
├─ AI output seems wrong → Pattern 2: Vibe Checking Checklist
├─ Not sure what to build → Pattern 3: Provide Clear Specs
├─ Conversation is stuck → Pattern 4: Restart When Stuck
├─ Complex error to debug → Pattern 5: Let It See What You See
├─ Doing same task repeatedly → Pattern 6: Automate Repeatable Steps
├─ AI keeps failing same way → Pattern 7: Build Personal Benchmarks
├─ Need same transformation again → Pattern 8: Store Formatting Prompts
├─ Need test data → Pattern 9: Generate Synthetic Data
├─ Long complex requirements → Pattern 10: Voice Workflows
├─ Need current/accurate info → Pattern 11: Context-Based Coding
└─ Have messy data to organize → Pattern 12: Raw to Structured
```

Remember: These patterns work best when combined and adapted to your specific workflow!
