# Pattern 3: Provide Clear Specs - Requirements Engineering

## The Problem with Vague Requirements

Jumping straight into implementation with unclear requirements leads to:
- Multiple iterations and rework
- Misaligned stakeholder expectations  
- Feature creep and scope bloat
- Poor architectural decisions

## The Clear Specs Pattern

**Flow**: Prompt for Spec → LLM Feedback → Refined Spec → Implementation

---

## Example 1: E-commerce Checkout System

### ❌ The Vague Approach
```
"Build a checkout system for our e-commerce site"
```
**Result**: AI makes assumptions, builds wrong thing, requires major rework

### ✅ The Clear Specs Approach

#### Step 1: Request Detailed Specification
```
"I need to build a checkout system for an e-commerce website. Help me create a comprehensive specification that includes:

1. User flows and journey mapping
2. Required data inputs and validation
3. Payment processing requirements
4. Error handling scenarios
5. Security considerations
6. Mobile responsiveness needs
7. Integration requirements with existing systems
8. Performance requirements
9. Accessibility requirements

Please create a detailed spec document that covers all these areas."
```

#### Step 2: AI Generated Specification
```markdown
# E-commerce Checkout System Specification

## 1. User Flows

### Primary Flow: Registered User
1. User reviews cart items
2. User enters/selects shipping address
3. User selects shipping method
4. User enters/selects payment method
5. User reviews order summary
6. User confirms and submits order
7. System processes payment
8. User receives confirmation

### Secondary Flow: Guest Checkout
1. User reviews cart items
2. User enters email address
3. User enters shipping address
4. User selects shipping method
5. User enters payment information
6. User reviews order summary
7. User confirms and submits order
8. System processes payment
9. User receives confirmation

### Error Flows
- Payment declined → retry with different method
- Out of stock item → remove or substitute

## Benefits of the Clear Specs Pattern

### ✅ Advantages
1. **Reduced Rework**: Clear requirements prevent building the wrong thing
2. **Better Architecture**: Comprehensive specs lead to better system design
3. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Everyone understands what's being built
4. **Risk Identification**: Specs reveal potential issues early
5. **Faster Implementation**: AI can generate better code with clear requirements
6. **Quality Improvement**: Detailed specs ensure edge cases are considered

### ⚠️ When to Use Sparingly
- **Simple, well-understood features**: Don't over-spec trivial functionality
- **Exploration phases**: Sometimes you need to prototype to understand requirements
- **Time-critical prototypes**: Balance thorough specs with speed needs
