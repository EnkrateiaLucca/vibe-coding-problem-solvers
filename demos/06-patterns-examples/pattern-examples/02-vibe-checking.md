## Quick Vibe Check Techniques

### The Sanity Check
```
Ask yourself: "Does this make basic sense?"

Examples:
- Does this business plan have realistic numbers?
- Does this training schedule have reasonable timing?
- Does this marketing copy match our brand voice?
- Does this project plan include the major steps?

If something feels obviously wrong, investigate further.
```

### The Completeness Scan
```
Ask yourself: "Are the main pieces here?"

For a business plan: Executive summary, market analysis, financials?
For marketing content: Key message, target audience, call to action?
For training materials: Learning objectives, activities, assessment?

Missing major pieces = red flag.
```

### The "Would I Be Comfortable..." Test
```
Ask yourself practical questions:

- Would I be comfortable sending this to a client?
- Would I be comfortable presenting this to my boss?
- Would I be comfortable using this as-is?
- Would I be comfortable having my name on this?

If the answer is "no," then it needs work.
```

## Remember: The Vibe Check Mindset

1. **Perfect is the enemy of good** - Catch major issues, not every minor flaw
2. **Speed matters** - If checking takes longer than creating, you're over-checking  
3. **Context is key** - A rough draft needs less checking than a final presentation
4. **Trust your instincts** - If something feels off, investigate further
5. **Learn from misses** - When your vibe check fails, understand what you missed

The goal is to catch 80% of problems with 20% of the effort!

**Quick reminder**: Vibe checking isn't about being perfect - it's about being smart with your time while maintaining quality standards.
