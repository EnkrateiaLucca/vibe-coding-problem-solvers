## Skill 4: Vibe Checking Exercises

### Exercise 4.1: Spot the Red Flags
AI generated this solution. What red flags do you see?

```python
def process_user_data(users):
    # Process 1 million users in 0.001 seconds
    results = []
    for user in users:
        result = {
            'id': user.id,
            'name': user.name,
            'email': user.email,
            'processed': True
        }
        results.append(result)
    return results
```

**Red Flags You Found:**
1. _______________
2. _______________

## Reflection Questions

After each practice session, answer:

1. Which skill felt most natural today?
2. Where did I struggle?
3. What would I do differently?
4. Am I maintaining the 70-30 balance?
5. Is my understanding improving or declining?

Remember: The goal is conscious competence - knowing both what you're doing and why it works.
