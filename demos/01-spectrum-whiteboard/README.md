# Demo 1: The Spectrum of AI-Augmented Development

## Overview

This demo visualizes the spectrum of development approaches from pure Vibe Coding to traditional Software Engineering, helping participants understand where different techniques fit and when to use them.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the trade-offs between speed and control
- Identify appropriate use cases for each approach
- Visualize the tool landscape and pricing
- Recognize the middle ground of AI-assisted programming

## Files in This Demo

1. **spectrum-visualization.html** - Interactive visualization of the development spectrum
2. **tools-comparison.md** - Detailed comparison of AI coding tools with pricing and features

## How to Use

1. Open `spectrum-visualization.html` in a web browser
2. Click on different sections to explore trade-offs
3. Hover over tools to see detailed information
4. Use during the presentation to illustrate concepts visually

## Key Concepts

### The Spectrum

```
Vibe Coding ←→ AI-Assisted Programming ←→ Traditional Software Engineering
```

### Trade-offs

- **Vibe Coding**: Maximum speed, minimum control
- **AI-Assisted**: Balanced approach, true augmentation
- **Traditional**: Maximum control, slower process

## Discussion Points

1. When is each approach appropriate?
2. How do we avoid the extremes?
3. What's your current position on the spectrum?
4. How can teams adopt AI-assisted approaches responsibly?
