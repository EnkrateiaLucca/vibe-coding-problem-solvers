# Demo 3: Practicing Prompting, Context and Capability Assessment

## Overview

This demo focuses on the foundational skills of vibe coding: crafting effective prompts, managing context strategically, and making smart decisions about what to delegate to AI.

## Learning Objectives

- Master the 6 sub-skills of effective prompting
- Learn context management strategies
- Develop capability assessment intuition
- Practice real-world scenarios

## Files in This Demo

1. **prompting-examples.md** - Comprehensive prompting patterns and examples
2. **context-management.md** - Strategies for managing conversation context
3. **capability-assessment.md** - Decision framework for AI delegation

## Demo Flow

1. **Start with Bad Examples** - Show common prompting mistakes
2. **Transform to Good** - Demonstrate improvement techniques
3. **Context Overload** - Show what happens with too much context
4. **Strategic Loading** - Demonstrate progressive context building
5. **Capability Matrix** - Use decision framework for delegation

## Key Concepts

### Prompting Hierarchy
```
1. Clear & Direct
2. Add Examples
3. Decompose Tasks
4. Assign Roles
5. Request Reasoning
6. Constrain Output
```

### Context Management
- Start minimal, add progressively
- Prioritize relevant information
- Refresh when conversations get long
- Use structured formats

### Capability Assessment
- Know AI strengths and limitations
- Delegate appropriately
- Maintain human oversight
- Preserve critical thinking

## Interactive Elements

During the demo:
1. Live prompt transformation exercise
2. Context building in real-time
3. Audience participation in capability decisions
4. Before/after comparisons

## Success Metrics

Participants should be able to:
- Write effective prompts in one attempt
- Manage context without overwhelming AI
- Make appropriate delegation decisions
- Recognize when not to use AI
