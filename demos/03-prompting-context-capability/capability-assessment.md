# Capability Assessment - What to Delegate to AI

## The Core Decision Framework

Knowing what to delegate to AI vs. handle yourself is crucial for effective AI-augmented development. This guide provides frameworks for making these decisions wisely.

## The Delegation Matrix

### üü¢ Definitely Delegate to AI

Tasks where AI excels and human review is straightforward:

| Task | Why AI Excels | Example |
|------|---------------|---------|
| **Boilerplate Generation** | Pattern-based, repetitive | CRUD endpoints, test scaffolds |
| **Data Transformation** | Clear input‚Üíoutput mapping | JSON to TypeScript interfaces |
| **Documentation Lookup** | Fast search and synthesis | "How to use React Context API" |
| **Code Formatting** | Rule-based, deterministic | Prettier/ESLint fixes |
| **Syntax Conversion** | Mechanical translation | Promise chains to async/await |
| **Mock Data Generation** | Creative but structured | Test fixtures, sample JSONs |
| **Regular Expressions** | Complex pattern matching | Email validation regex |

#### Example: Boilerplate Generation
```
‚úÖ Good delegation:
"Generate Express.js CRUD endpoints for a User model with:
- GET /users (paginated)
- GET /users/:id  
- POST /users
- PUT /users/:id
- DELETE /users/:id
Include error handling and validation"
```

### üü° Delegate with Careful Review

Tasks where AI helps but requires human judgment:

| Task | Why Review Needed | Example |
|------|-------------------|---------|
| **Algorithm Implementation** | Logic correctness critical | Sorting, searching algorithms |
| **API Integration** | Version/auth specifics | Third-party service integration |
| **Database Queries** | Performance implications | Complex JOINs, aggregations |
| **Business Logic** | Domain expertise required | Pricing calculations, workflows |
| **Error Handling** | Edge cases matter | Retry logic, fallback behavior |
| **Unit Tests** | Coverage quality varies | Test case generation |

#### Example: Algorithm with Review
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Delegate but verify:
"Implement binary search for a sorted array of objects.
Search by the 'timestamp' property.
Handle edge cases: empty array, not found, duplicates"

// Review for: off-by-one errors, edge case handling
```

---

### üî¥ Keep Human-Controlled

Tasks requiring human judgment, creativity, or critical thinking:

| Task | Why Human Needed | Example |
|------|------------------|---------|
| **System Architecture** | Long-term implications | Microservice boundaries |
| **Security Implementation** | Risk too high | Authentication, encryption |
| **Performance Optimization** | Requires profiling/analysis | Database indexing strategy |
| **API Design** | User experience critical | REST vs GraphQL decision |
| **Code Review** | Quality assessment | PR reviews, best practices |
| **Debugging Complex Issues** | Requires deep understanding | Race conditions, memory leaks |
| **Technology Selection** | Strategic decision | Framework/library choices |

#### Example: Architecture Decision
```
‚ùå Don't delegate:
"Should we use microservices or monolith?"
"Design our authentication system"
"Choose our tech stack"

‚úÖ Instead, use AI for research:
"Compare microservices vs monolith for a 5-person startup"
"List authentication best practices for SaaS"
```

## Decision Trees

### Quick Decision Tree
```
Is it a creative/strategic decision?
‚îú‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Keep human-controlled
‚îî‚îÄ No ‚Üí Continue ‚Üì

Does it involve security/sensitive data?
‚îú‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Keep human-controlled
‚îî‚îÄ No ‚Üí Continue ‚Üì

Is it repetitive/pattern-based?
‚îú‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Delegate to AI
‚îî‚îÄ No ‚Üí Continue ‚Üì

Can you easily verify correctness?
‚îú‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Delegate with review
‚îî‚îÄ No ‚Üí Keep human-controlled
```

## Key Principles

1. **Start Conservative**: Better to under-delegate than over-delegate
2. **Build Trust Gradually**: Expand delegation as you verify quality
3. **Always Verify Critical Path**: Never blindly trust security/business logic
4. **Learn from Mistakes**: Track what goes wrong and why
5. **Maintain Core Skills**: Don't delegate away your fundamental abilities
6. **Context Matters**: Same task might need different approach per project

## Remember

> "The goal isn't to delegate everything to AI, but to create an optimal partnership where each party does what they do best."

Effective capability assessment is a skill that improves with practice. Start small, track results, and continuously refine your approach.
