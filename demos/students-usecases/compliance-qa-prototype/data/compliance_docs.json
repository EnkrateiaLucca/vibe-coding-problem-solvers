      "title": "Access Control Requirements",
      "content": "Access to assets and associated facilities is limited to authorized users, processes, and devices. This includes managing identities and credentials, authenticating users and devices, and managing access permissions and authorizations. Organizations should implement multi-factor authentication for privileged accounts and remote access."

      "title": "Role-Based Access Control",
      "content": "Access permissions and authorizations are managed using role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC). Permissions are based on job function and follow the principle of least privilege. Users are granted only the minimum access necessary to perform their duties."

      "content": "Identities are proofed and bound to credentials based on the context of interactions. Strong authentication mechanisms include multi-factor authentication (MFA) combining something you know (password), something you have (token), and something you are (biometrics). Credentials are protected from unauthorized disclosure and modification."
