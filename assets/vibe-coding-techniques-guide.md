## Definition and Origin

### What is Vibe Coding?

**Vibe coding** is a software development approach introduced by Andrej Karpathy (co-founder of OpenAI and former AI leader at Tesla) in February 2025. The term describes building software with Large Language Models (LLMs) through natural language descriptions while "fully giving in to the vibes, embracing exponentials, and forgetting that the code even exists."

### Key Characteristics

- **Intent-first development**: Developers express what they want in plain language
- **AI-generated implementation**: LLMs transform natural language requirements into executable code
- **Minimal code review**: Unlike traditional AI-assisted programming, vibe coding involves accepting AI-generated code without deep inspection
- **Rapid iteration**: Focus on speed and experimentation over code structure and optimization

### Simon Willison's Important Distinction

Computer scientist Simon Willison emphasizes a crucial distinction in his March 2025 analysis:

> "When I talk about vibe coding, I mean building software with an LLM without reviewing the code it writes. Not all AI-assisted programming is vibe coding."

This distinction separates:
- **Vibe coding**: Building with LLMs without reviewing generated code
- **Responsible AI-assisted programming**: Using LLMs while maintaining code review and understanding

| **Use Case** | Prototypes, experiments, throwaway projects | Production systems, critical applications |
| **Speed** | Maximum velocity | Balanced speed and quality |
| **Risk Tolerance** | High (acceptable for low stakes) | Low (quality and security critical) |
| **Skill Requirements** | Prompt engineering, system design | Programming fundamentals + AI collaboration |

### Simon Willison's Golden Rule

> "The golden rule for production-quality AI-assisted programming is that you won't commit any code to your repository if you couldn't explain exactly what it does to somebody else."

This rule clearly delineates when to use each approach:

- **Vibe coding**: When you can accept the risk of not understanding every detail
- **AI-assisted programming**: When you need to explain and maintain the code long-term
