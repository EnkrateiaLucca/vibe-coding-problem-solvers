So today I have to finish teaching my Vibe Coding course. Then I'm going to have to make updates to the repo to make sure that students can take in all of the prompts that I discussed. And then tonight I have to have some pizza around 9.30 p.m. and do some training. Tomorrow I have to prepare my AI No Code Tools course. That's going to happen on Thursday. 2 p.m. on Thursday I'm going to teach a No Codes course. And after that I think I'm just going to do a small trip and probably go to the Netherlands from Friday until Monday to just chill out and hang out.
