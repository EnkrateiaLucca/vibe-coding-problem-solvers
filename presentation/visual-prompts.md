## Style Guide for All Prompts

When generating images, add these style modifiers:
- **For professional slides:** `clean corporate illustration, flat design, modern tech aesthetic, subtle gradients, professional presentation quality`
- **For conceptual slides:** `minimalist infographic style, clear visual metaphor, limited color palette, white or light background`
- **For comparison slides:** `split-screen composition, clear contrast, red vs green or warm vs cool color coding`
- **For process slides:** `horizontal flow, connected steps, numbered sequence, clean arrows`

**Aspect ratio:** Always use 16:9 for presentation slides

**Color palette suggestion:**
- Primary: #3498db (blue), #27ae60 (green), #e74c3c (red), #f39c12 (orange), #9b59b6 (purple)
- Backgrounds: White, #f8f9fa (light gray), soft gradients
